# Canvas Import SQL Scripts
This repository contains SQL Scripts used to create .csv files from Infinite Campus which are later imported to the Canvas Learning Management System.

MS SQL Scripts are provided as examples with the intent of providing basic logic for project collaboration.
This is a 'first-pass' attempt at trying to help/collaborate with other districts using Infinite Campus who would like to automate integration with the Canvas Learning Management System.
